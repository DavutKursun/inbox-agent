# Design notes — inbox-agent

## Why hand-written loop, not a framework
A client who buys an agent needs to read it. The loop is ~150 lines: prompt, tool calls, policy check,
trace. Swapping the model is one environment variable; swapping a tool is one function.

## Safety model
- Policy is a table (`policy.py`), consulted by code, not by the model.
- Approval-level tools are queued; the model is told "queued" and must tell the customer it is pending.
- Ownership checks live in the tools: lookup_customer only returns the sender's own record, a customer can only
  cancel their own bookings, book_slot refuses a customer_id that does not match the sender.
- Suspicious emails: lexical markers (cheap, transparent) flag the thread; approval tools are refused for the
  whole thread. Only explicit override phrases (English and Turkish) are markers; ordinary words such as "refund"
  are not, because there is no refund tool and a refund request is escalated by policy. The eval's adversarial
  group measures whether this plus the prompt holds up.
- The email is wrapped in `<email>` tags and described as data; the eval measures injection success.

## Fixtures
Seeded and dated: `make_fixtures.py --today 2026-10-19` writes the CRM, calendar and samples for that date and records
it in `data/fixtures_today.txt`; `run_one.py` (and later the eval) use it as their default "today", so free slots,
"next week" and the cancel sample's booking stay consistent however long after generation the agent runs.

## Knowledge base
BM25 over heading-level chunks of nine markdown pages; chunk ids like `prices#price-list` are what drafts cite.
A draft that mentions money, hours or policy without a valid citation is flagged `unverified_claim`.

## Cost accounting
Measured tokens × list prices (`costs.py`); free tiers labelled "free tier"; Claude Haiku quoted "as if" so a
paying client can compare.
